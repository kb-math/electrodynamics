# electrodynamics

Plots the electric field of a moving point charge. More precisely, it is the LiÃ©nardâ€“Wiechert electric field as given in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A9nard%E2%80%93Wiechert_potential#Field_computation

##### React F/E (in construction):

1. Install dependency: navigate to `react-client` folder, then run `>>> yarn`
2. Start server to listen to F/E requests
3. Run F/E: (in the same `react-client` folder): run `>>> yarn web`
