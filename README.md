# electrodynamics

Plots the electric field of a moving point charge. More precisely, it is the Liénard–Wiechert electric field as given in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A9nard%E2%80%93Wiechert_potential#Field_computation

##### React F/E (in construction):
1. Install `expo-cli` globally using `yarn`
2. Install dependency: navigate to `react-client` folder, then run `>>> yarn`
3. Start server to listen to F/E requests
4. Run F/E: (in the same `react-client` folder): run `>>> yarn web`
